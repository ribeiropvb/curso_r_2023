        - Basic Concepts;
        - Measures of central tendency;
        - Measures of dispersion;
        - Data visualization techniques;
        - Discrete probability distributions;
        - Continuous probability distributions.

    2. Second Module
        - Confidence intervals;
        - Hypothesis testing;
        - Parametric and non-parametric tests;
        - One-way ANOVA;

    3. Third Module
        - Simple linear regression;
        - Multiple linear regression;
        - Generalized linear regression.

    4. Fourth Module
        - Autoregressive models;
        - Moving average models;
        - Seasonal decomposition.

    8. Last Module
        - Principal component analysis (PCA);
        - Cluster analysis;
        - Machine learning algorithms.
